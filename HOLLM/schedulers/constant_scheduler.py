        Determines the number of samples to generate.

        This method calculates the number of samples needed for the
        optimization process. If the number of samples is explicitly
        specified, it returns that number. Otherwise, it computes the number
        based on the difference between the maximum context configurations
        and the number of observed configurations.

            int: The number of samples to generate.

        - start_samples: The number of samples to start with.
