# Multi-objective optimization task

## Problem Description
Atom set: Use standard drug-like atoms including carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus, halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine), and optionally silicon.

pH-dependent forms: Generate protonated and tautomeric states observable at physiological pH (6â€“8) with at least 20% relative population; optionally generate forms for other pH ranges as needed.

3D Conformation: Build multiple 3D conformers per molecule using an energy window (e.g., 12.5 kcal/mol), limit to a maximum number of conformers (e.g., up to 600), and enforce diversity with an RMS threshold (e.g., 0.80).

Property Calculation: Compute key physicochemical properties such as logP, polar surface area, molecular weight, numbers of hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors, and desolvation energies.

Diversity and Availability: Ensure chemical diversity using clustering methods based on Tanimoto similarity and include compounds with verified vendor availability.

## Constraints
The allowable ranges for the hyperparameters are:
$constraints

## Previously Evaluated Architectures
Below are examples of architectures that have been evaluated, showing their operations and performance metrics:

$ICL_examples

## Your Task
Generate $target_number_of_candidates new architecture configurations that:
1. Are likely to achieve lower $metrics than the examples
2. Are different from all previously evaluated architectures
3. Satisfy all the specified constraints

## Output Format
Each configuration has to follow this format:

$candidate_sampler_response_format

Provide your response in a JSON list containing each proposed configuration.
Return only the required JSON list output without additional text.
