# Configuration Performance Prediction

## Problem Description
Atom set: Use standard drug-like atoms including carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus, halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine), and optionally silicon.

pH-dependent forms: Generate protonated and tautomeric states observable at physiological pH (6â€“8) with at least 20% relative population; optionally generate forms for other pH ranges as needed.

3D Conformation: Build multiple 3D conformers per molecule using an energy window (e.g., 12.5 kcal/mol), limit to a maximum number of conformers (e.g., up to 600), and enforce diversity with an RMS threshold (e.g., 0.80).

Property Calculation: Compute key physicochemical properties such as logP, polar surface area, molecular weight, numbers of hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors, and desolvation energies.

Diversity and Availability: Ensure chemical diversity using clustering methods based on Tanimoto similarity and include compounds with verified vendor availability.
## Reference configurations with Known Performance
Below are examples of configurations that have been evaluated, showing their operations and performance metrics:

$ICL_examples

## Candidate configurations to Evaluate
You must predict performance for these new configurations:

$target_architectures

## Your Task
1. Predict the $metrics value for each candidate configuration
2. Base your predictions on patterns in the reference examples

## Output Format
Each evaluation has to follow this format:
