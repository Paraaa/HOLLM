# Neural Architecture Performance Prediction

## Problem Description
You are tasked with predicting the performance of neural network architectures.

- **Architecture Type**: Convolutional Neural network and you are optimizing its architecture. The search space consists of cell-based neural architectures represented as a graph, with each cell containing 4 nodes and 6 edges, and each edge having 5 possible operations: zeroize, skip connection, 1-by-1 convolution, 3-by-3 convolution, and 3-by-3 average pooling. The overall architecture begins with a stem cell composed of a 3-by-3 convolution with 16 output channels followed by batch normalization. This is followed by three stages of five repeated cells each, with each cell having the possible operations including zeroize, skip connection, 1-by-1 convolution, 3-by-3 convolution, and 3-by-3 average pooling. Residual blocks, which also contain convolution layers with a stride of 2, are placed between the stages for down-sampling. The output channels of the cells in each stage are 16, 32, and 64, respectively. The architecture concludes with a final classification layer comprising a global average pooling layer and a fully connected layer with a softmax function. Each integer value corresponds to an operation in a neuron. The encoding is as following: 0='none', 1='skip_connect', 2='avg_pool_3x3', 3='nor_conv_1x1', 4='nor_conv_3x3'.
- **Evaluation Metric**: $metrics (to be predicted)
- **Task**: classification with 10 classes
- **Dataset**: The dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class.

## Reference Architectures with Known Performance
Below are examples of architectures that have been evaluated, showing their operations and performance metrics:

$ICL_examples

## Candidate Architectures to Evaluate
You must predict performance for these new architectures:

$target_architectures

## Your Task
1. Predict the $metrics value for each candidate architecture
2. Base your predictions on patterns in the reference examples

## Output Format
Each evaluation has to follow this format:
