# Neural Architecture Search Task

## Problem Description
You are tasked with finding optimal neural network architectures for image classification on CIFAR-10.

- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10
  - 60,000 color images (32x32 pixels)
  - 10 classes with 6,000 images per class

- **Representation**: Each architecture is encoded as a sequence of integers
  - 0 = 'none'
  - 1 = 'skip_connect'
  - 2 = 'avg_pool_3x3'
  - 3 = 'nor_conv_1x1'
  - 4 = 'nor_conv_3x3'

- **Evaluation**: Architectures are measured by $metrics (lower is better)

## Constraints
The allowable ranges for the hyperparameters are:
$region_constraints

## Previously Evaluated Architectures
Below are examples of architectures that have been evaluated, showing their operations and performance metrics:

$Region_ICL_examples



## Your Task
Generate $target_number_of_candidates new architecture configurations that:
1. Are likely to achieve lower $metrics than the examples
2. Are different from all previously evaluated architectures
3. Satisfy all the specified constraints

## Output Format
Each configuration has to follow this format:

$candidate_sampler_response_format

Provide your response in a JSON list containing each proposed configuration.
Return only the required JSON list output without additional text. ```json ```
