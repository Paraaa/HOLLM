The following are Neural Architecture Search (NAS) operations for a $model_desc. 
For each architecture is given the corresponding performance measured in $metrics. 
The model is evaluated on an image $task task and the label contains $n_classes classes.
$dataset_desc. 

$ICL_examples 

Your response should only contain the predicted $metrics in the format: ```json $surrogate_model_response_format. ```
Do not return any other text and make the response as short as possible! 

The following are the candidate architectures you have to evaluate.
$target_architectures

Focus on the most important analysis and do not think for a lot of time.
Limit your thinking to less than 5000 tokens.
Return 1 evaluation for each candidate listed in a JSON list JSON format.
