# Neural Architecture Performance Prediction

## Problem Description
You are tasked with predicting the performance of neural network architectures.

- **Architecture Type**: $model_desc
- **Evaluation Metric**: $metrics (to be predicted)
- **Task**: $task with $n_classes classes
- **Dataset**: $dataset_desc

## Reference Architectures with Known Performance
Below are examples of architectures that have been evaluated, showing their operations and performance metrics:

$ICL_examples

## Candidate Architectures to Evaluate
You must predict performance for these new architectures:

$target_architectures

## Your Task
1. Predict the $metrics value for each candidate architecture
2. Base your predictions on patterns in the reference examples

## Output Format
Each evaluation has to follow this format:

$surrogate_model_response_format

Provide your response in a JSON list containing each proposed evaluation.
Return only the required JSON list output without additional text. ```json ```
