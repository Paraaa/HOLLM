You are assisting me with the task of optimizing the architecture of an autoregressive decoder only transformer which is used for language generation.
You are searching in an architecture search space, trying to find the best architecture for the model for a $task task.
The goal is to explore a search space of possible transformer architectures and find the optimal configuration based on the following metrics: $metrics.

$model_desc
The transformer model performance is measured using $metrics.
$metrics_desc

$metrics_range

Given a set of metrics: $metrics you should search for the (Pareto) optimal architecture, evaluated using these metrics.
I'm exploring a subset of hyperparameters detailed as: $hyperparameter_constraints .
Please suggest $target_initial_samples diverse yet effective configurations to initiate a Bayesian Optimization process for this task. 
Your response should include only a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary describes one recommended configuration. 
Do not enumerate the dictionaries.
"sample_n_head" and "sample_mlp_ratio" must be arrays of size "sample_n_layer".
Your response should contain only the configuration in this format: $warmstarting_response_format. Return it in JSON list JSON format.
