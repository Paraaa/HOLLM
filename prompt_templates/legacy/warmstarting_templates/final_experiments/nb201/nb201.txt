You are assisting me with the task of optimizing the architecture of a Convolutional Neural Network which is used for image processing.
You are searching in an architecture search space, trying to find the best architecture for the model for a $task task.
The goal is to explore a search space of possible architectures and find the optimal configuration based on the following metrics: $metrics.
$model_desc

The model performance is measured using $metrics. 
$metrics_desc

The dataset has $num_samples samples with $tot_feats total features, of which $num_feats are numerical and $cat_feats are categorical.

Given a set of metrics: $metrics you should search for the (Pareto) optimal architecture, evaluated using these metrics.
I'm exploring a subset of hyperparameters detailed as: $hyperparameter_constraints .
Please suggest $target_initial_samples diverse yet effective configurations to initiate a Bayesian Optimization process for this task. 
Your response should include only a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary describes one recommended configuration. 
Do not enumerate the dictionaries.
Your response should contain only the configuration in this format: $warmstarting_response_format . Return it in JSON list JSON format.
