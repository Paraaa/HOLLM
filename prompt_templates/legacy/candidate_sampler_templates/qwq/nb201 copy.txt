The following are examples of performance of a $model_desc measured in $metrics and the corresponding neuron operations. The architectures with lower $metrics are better. Each integer value corresponds to an operation in a neuron. The encoding is as following: 0='none', 1='skip_connect', 2='avg_pool_3x3', 3='nor_conv_1x1', 4='nor_conv_3x3' The model is evaluated on a image $task task containing $n_classes classes. The task is CIFAR-10. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. The image dataset contains $num_samples samples and $tot_feats features ($cat_feats categorical, $num_feats numerical). The allowable ranges for the hyperparameters are: $hyperparameter_constraints

Your task is to help me find a better architecture that has lower metrics than the observed configurations.

The architecture should not be the same as any of the already evaluated architectures above.
Your response should contain only the configuration in this format: ```json $candidate_sampler_response_format. ```
Be concise in your thinking.
Return $target_number_of_candidates samples in a JSON list JSON format.
