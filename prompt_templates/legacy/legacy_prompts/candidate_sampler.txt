The following are examples of performance of a Convolutional Neural network and you are optimizing its architecture. The search space consists of cell-based neural architectures represented as a graph, with each cell containing 4 nodes and 6 edges, and each edge having 5 possible operations: zeroize, skip connection, 1-by-1 convolution, 3-by-3 convolution, and 3-by-3 average pooling. The overall architecture begins with a stem cell composed of a 3-by-3 convolution with 16 output channels followed by batch normalization. This is followed by three stages of five repeated cells each, with each cell having the possible operations including zeroize, skip connection, 1-by-1 convolution, 3-by-3 convolution, and 3-by-3 average pooling. Residual blocks, which also contain convolution layers with a stride of 2, are placed between the stages for down-sampling. The output channels of the cells in each stage are 16, 32, and 64, respectively. The architecture concludes with a final classification layer comprising a global average pooling layer and a fully connected layer with a softmax function. Each integer value corresponds to an operation in a neuron. The encoding is as following: 0='none', 1='skip_connect', 2='avg_pool_3x3', 3='nor_conv_1x1', 4='nor_conv_3x3'. measured in performance and latency and the corresponding neuron operations. The architectures with lower performance and latency are better. Each integer value corresponds to an operation in a neuron. The encoding is as following: 0='none', 1='skip_connect', 2='avg_pool_3x3', 3='nor_conv_1x1', 4='nor_conv_3x3' The model is evaluated on a image classification task containing 10 classes. The task is CIFAR-10. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. The image dataset contains 60000 samples and 1024 features (0 categorical, 1024 numerical).

The allowable ranges for the hyperparameters are:

Your task is to help me find a better architecture that has $metrics than the observed configurations.

The architecture should not be the same as any of the already evaluated architectures above.
Your response should contain only the configuration in this format: $candidate_sampler_response_format.
