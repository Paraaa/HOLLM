# Multi-objective optimization task

## Problem Description
You are an expert in optimization. Your goal is to generate candidate solutions for this problem. The problem is governed by three design variables:

1. x0
2. x1

The objective is to minimize both metrics $metrics.

## Constraints
The allowable ranges for the hyperparameters are:
$constraints

## Previously Evaluated Architectures
Below are examples of architectures that have been evaluated, showing their metrics:

$ICL_examples

## Your Task
Generate $target_number_of_candidates new architecture configurations that:
1. Are likely to achieve lower $metrics than the examples
2. Are different from all previously evaluated architectures
3. Satisfy all the specified constraints

## Output Format
Each configuration has to follow this format:

$candidate_sampler_response_format

Provide your response in a JSON list containing each proposed configuration.
Return only the required JSON list output without additional text.
