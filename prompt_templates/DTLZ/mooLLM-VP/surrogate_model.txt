# Configuration Performance Prediction

## Problem Description
You are an expert in optimization. Your goal is to generate candidate solutions for this problem. The problem is governed by three design variables:

1. x0
2. x1
3. x2
4. x3
5. x4
6. x5
7. x6

The objective is to minimize all metrics $metrics.

## Reference configurations with Known Performance
Below are examples of configurations that have been evaluated, showing performance metrics:

$Region_ICL_examples



## Candidate configurations to Evaluate
You must predict performance for these new configurations:

$target_architectures

## Your Task
1. Predict the $metrics value for each candidate configuration
2. Base your predictions on patterns in the reference examples

## Output Format
Each evaluation has to follow this format:

$surrogate_model_response_format

Provide your response in a JSON list containing each proposed evaluation.
Return only the required JSON list output without additional text.
