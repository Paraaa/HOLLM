# Multi-objective optimization task

## Problem Description
You are an expert in optimization. Your goal is to generate candidate solutions for this problem. The problem is governed by three design variables:

1. x0
2. x1
3. x2
4. x3
5. x4
6. x5
7. x6

The objective is to minimize all metrics $metrics.

## Constraints
The allowable ranges for the hyperparameters are:
$region_constraints

## Previously Evaluated Architectures
Below are examples of architectures that have been evaluated, showing their metrics:

$Region_ICL_examples



## Your Task
Generate $target_number_of_candidates new architecture configurations that:
1. Are likely to achieve lower $metrics than the examples
2. Are different from all previously evaluated architectures
3. Satisfy all the specified constraints

## Output Format
Each configuration has to follow this format:

$candidate_sampler_response_format

Provide your response in a JSON list containing each proposed configuration.
Return only the required JSON list output without additional text.
