# Optimization task

## Problem Description
You are tasked with solving a optimization problem that requires finding optimal solutions.

- **Evaluation**: Configurations are measured by $metrics

## Constraints
The allowable ranges for the hyperparameters are:
$region_constraints

## Previously Evaluated Architectures
Below are examples of architectures that have been evaluated, showing their operations and performance metrics:

$Region_ICL_examples

## Your Task
Generate $target_number_of_candidates new architecture configurations that:
1. Are likely to achieve lower $metrics than the examples
2. Are different from all previously evaluated architectures
3. Satisfy all the specified constraints: $region_constraints

## Output Format
Each configuration has to follow this format:

$candidate_sampler_response_format

Provide your response in a JSON list containing each proposed configuration.
Return only the required JSON list output without additional text.
