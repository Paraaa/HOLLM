# Configuration Performance Prediction

## Problem Description
You are tasked with predicting the performance of configurations.

- **Evaluation Metric**: $metrics (to be predicted)
- **Constraint**: The allowable ranges for the hyperparameter are: $constraints

## Reference configurations with Known Performance
Below are examples of configurations that have been evaluated, showing their operations and performance metrics:

$ICL_examples

## Candidate configurations to Evaluate
You must predict performance for these new configurations:

$target_architectures

## Your Task
1. Predict the $metrics value for each candidate configuration
2. Base your predictions on patterns in the reference examples

## Output Format
Each evaluation has to follow this format:

$surrogate_model_response_format

Provide your response in a JSON list containing each proposed evaluation.
Return only the required JSON list output without additional text.
